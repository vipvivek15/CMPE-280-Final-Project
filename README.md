# Progressive-Web-Application-Task-Management

## Description
This repository contains the final project for **CMPE 280**. The project is a **Progressive Web Application (PWA)** for task management that enables users to efficiently create, manage, and track their tasks in various formats. By combining the responsiveness of modern web technologies with the capabilities of a native application, this PWA delivers a seamless and interactive user experience.

The application includes features such as task categorization, due date reminders, and progress tracking. It also integrates with external APIs to enhance functionality, such as providing suggestions for task prioritization.

## Features
- **Task Creation and Categorization**: Easily create tasks and organize them by category (e.g., work, personal, urgent).
- **Progress Tracking**: Visualize the progress of tasks using interactive charts and timelines.
- **Offline Support**: The PWA allows users to manage tasks even without an internet connection.
- **API Integration**: Connects with external services for additional features like AI-based task prioritization (requires an OpenAI key).
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for use on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Search and Filtering**: Quickly find tasks using robust search and filtering options.
